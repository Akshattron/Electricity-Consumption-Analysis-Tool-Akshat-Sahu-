# Electricity Consumption Analysis Tool 

Hi there! Welcome to my **Electricity Consumption Analysis** project. 

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Akshat_Sahu.ipynb`) where I dive into electricity data to uncover patterns, trends, and maybe a few surprises about how we consume energy.

# About The Project

I built this tool to analyze electricity consumption data effectively. The goal was to take raw data and turn it into meaningful insights—whether that's looking at peak usage times, seasonal trends, or just visualizing the load over a specific period.

**What this notebook does:**
* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and formatting the data so it's ready for analysis.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the data to spot trends (line charts, bar graphs, etc.).
* **Statistical Analysis:** (If applicable) Checking for correlations or specific consumption metrics.

# Tech Stack

This project is built using Python and runs in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Here are the main libraries I used:

* **Python 3.14**
* **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
* **NumPy** (for numerical calculations)
* **Matplotlib (for making the charts look good)
* *Note: If I used Scikit-learn for prediction or statsmodels, make sure to install those too!*

## How to Run It

If you want to run this analysis on your own machine, here is how you can do it:

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Akshattron/Electricity-Consumption-Analysis-Tool-Akshat-Sahu-.git](https://github.com/Akshattron/Electricity-Consumption-Analysis-Tool-Akshat-Sahu-.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the folder:**
    ```bash
    cd Electricity-Consumption-Analysis-Tool-Akshat-Sahu-
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. Usually, this does the trick:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```
4.  **Launch Jupyter:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
5.  Open `Akshat_Sahu.ipynb` and run the cells!

This is a personal project, but I'm open to ideas! If you spot a bug in my code or think of a cooler way to visualize the data, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
